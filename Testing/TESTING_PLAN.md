## üö® Critical Test Points

### Must-Pass Scenarios
1. **Basic conversion functionality** - All format conversions must work
2. **Backup creation** - Every conversion must create appropriate backup
3. **Restoration capability** - All conversions must be reversible
4. **No data loss** - Original images must be recoverable
5. **Error handling** - No PHP fatal errors under any circumstances

### Performance Benchmarks
- Single conversion: < 5 seconds for images < 2MB
- Batch conversion: < 30 seconds for 10 images
- Memory usage: < 100MB for typical operations
- No timeouts on standard hosting environments

### Security Requirements
- All AJAX endpoints require proper nonces
- User capability checks enforced
- File operations properly validated
- No arbitrary code execution vulnerabilities

## üîÑ Regression Testing

Before each release, run core functionality tests:
- [ ] Upload processing still works
- [ ] Existing backup/restore system functional
- [ ] Settings page loads and saves correctly
- [ ] Bulk optimization features intact
- [ ] No conflicts with existing features
