Pic Pilot – Plugin Functionality Overview
What Is Pic Pilot?
Pic Pilot is a modern, modular WordPress plugin for site owners, bloggers, agencies, and developers who want granular control over image optimization, backup, and restoration—while maintaining full compatibility with the WordPress Media Library and best performance practices.

Key Goals:

Reduce image file size to speed up websites

Allow lossless restoration of original images and thumbnails

Keep backups and optimization in the user's control (no locked-in external services required)

Features at Project Start
When we began this phase, Pic Pilot already provided:

Image Optimization:

Local JPEG compression (with planned support for more engines, including external services for PNG and eventually WebP).

Smart router to pick the best available compression engine per image type and settings.

Media Library Integration:

Custom “Optimize” action and status in the WordPress Media Library.

Visual feedback on optimization status (button, saved space, errors).

Settings UI:

Toggle for backup, auto-optimize on upload, and engine selection.

Initial Backup Capability:

Optional backup of original image before optimization (basic/legacy implementation).

What We’ve Just Achieved
We have designed and implemented a robust, next-generation backup and restore system with these major improvements:

1. Comprehensive Backup System
When enabled, every image to be optimized is fully backed up:

Main (scaled) image and all WordPress-generated thumbnails are copied into a dedicated backup folder per attachment in /uploads/pic-pilot-backups/{attachment_id}/.

Each backup includes a manifest file recording file names, original locations, and backup timestamp/version.

No backup of “unattached/originals” unless specifically requested.

2. Safe, User-Friendly Restore
Restore operation overwrites the main and all thumbnail files for an attachment with the exact copies from the backup—no orphaned files, no broken links.

Restoration updates a meta key (_pic_pilot_restore_version) so the plugin knows when an image was last restored.

3. Smart, Versioned UI Feedback
Media Library and Backup Manager screens both:

Compare the backup “restore version” and the last “optimized version” (tracked via post meta).

Show clear buttons and statuses:

“Restored” with “Optimize Now” (if restored, not yet re-optimized)

“Optimized” and saved stats (if not restored since)

“Restore”/“Restored” state in backup list, always in sync

No accidental overwrites or false status: user always sees the true state of each image.

4. Robust Delete/Cleanup Logic
Backups can be deleted per image (removing all associated files/folders).

(Planned: bulk and automated cleanup.)

5. Modular, DRY, Modern Architecture
All logic is namespaced and modularized (SRP, PSR-4, Composer).

All UI actions use nonces and permission checks for security.

Easily extensible for future: webp support, cloud storage, smarter UI, async tasks.

Why This Matters
Performance: Users can optimize images safely, knowing they can always revert.

Disk Savings: No unnecessary backups—only as many as the user needs, with clear tools to clean up.

Reliability: Full thumbnail backup/restore prevents page builder or theme breakage.

Transparency: The UI always reflects the real image state—never any guesswork.

Next Steps / Planned Features
Support for WebP backup and restoration (with similar logic)

“Optimize on upload” and “bulk optimize” flows using this robust backup engine

Optional advanced settings for removing unused “true original” files for further space savings

Bulk/auto cleanup of old backups and advanced search/filter tools in the Backup Manager

In short:
Pic Pilot now offers best-in-class image optimization with bulletproof backup and restoration—giving users speed, safety, and full control.
